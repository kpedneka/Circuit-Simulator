#Circuit Simulator
This is a program that attempts to simulate a real life circuit using the AND, NOT, OR, Multiplexer, and Decoder gates.

Circuits are described by their input files, which you can find in the test cases folder. In this repository, you will find 2 implementations.

The implementation in the folder "first" works perfectly for test cases that present a circuit in order. 

They will not work for implementations that present a circuit out of order (see test cases for a better understanding of what I mean). For these kinds of circuits, an expression tree would be required. This is the second implementation, currently a work in progress, and can be found in the folder "second".
